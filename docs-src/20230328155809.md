## Download
<blockquote class="is-warning"><b>Warning:</b> The files need to stay located in the same folder.</blockquote>

## Prerequisites
Node.js: Node.js is needed to send out the action via the command line to Streamer.bot. Install: https://nodejs.org/ you can choose either versions. To verify it's installed correctly go the your command line (<kbd>windows</kbd> <kbd>+</kbd> <kbd>r</kbd> --> `cmd`) and type `node -v` and if it says `v.....` you have installed it correctly.

HTTP Server: in Streamer.bot the HTTP Server needs to be enabled, you can leave it at the default settings, but if you choose to change it go to the `action.cjs` file and change the settings at the top of the file.

## Installation
![GIF showcasing the build script](/Extensions/Local-Script-Action-Handler/overview.gif)

In the `.zip` file attached there is a folder, this by default contains two files: `_action.cjs`, `_build.bat` you don't have to touch the `_action.cjs`. To make the scripts you need to use the `_build.bat` file, open this file and fill in the form. After you've filled in this form there will be two new files in your folder. a `.bat` and a `.vbs` file, I'll recommended you to use the `.vbs` file, but you can also use the `.bat` file fine (note: the `.bat` file will temporarily open a black window).
